Odoo is a suite of web based open source business apps.

This repository contains two custom solutions built on Odoo 17:

1. **ap_invoice_request**: An Odoo module for external invoice requests
2. **client_app**: A standalone REST API service using Odoo's XML-RPC API

## 1. External Invoice Request Module (ap_invoice_request)

The External Invoice Request module provides a secure way for customers to request invoices for their sales orders without requiring an Odoo login.

### Key Features

-   **External Web Access**: Customers can access their uninvoiced sales orders through a unique URL
-   **Token-based Security**: Optional tokens provide secure access for specific customers
-   **Intuitive Interface**: User-friendly web interface for selecting orders for invoicing
-   **Admin Approval**: Backend workflow for reviewing and approving invoice requests
-   **PDF Downloads**: Automatic PDF for approved invoices

### Installation

1. Install the module from the Apps menu or via command line:
    ```bash
    python odoo-bin -c odoo.conf -d your_database -i ap_invoice_request
    ```

### Usage

**For Customers:**

-   Access `/sale-orders/to-invoice` to see all uninvoiced orders
-   Access `/external/sale-invoice/<token>` for customer-specific orders
-   Select an order and submit an invoice request
-   Download the PDF once approved

**For Administrators:**

-   Navigate to Accounting â†’ Invoice Requests
-   Review and approve/reject pending requests
-   Access the external form via the "View External Form" button

## 2. XML-RPC Client API (client_app)

A standalone REST API service that interfaces with Odoo through its XML-RPC API, providing a simpler interface for managing Sales Orders.

### Key Features

-   **Complete Sales Order Management**: Create, read, update sales orders
-   **Action Support**: Confirm, cancel, reset sales orders to draft
-   **REST API Interface**: Simple JSON-based HTTP endpoints

### Installation

1. Navigate to the client_app directory
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Configure Odoo connection in `.env` file
4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

### API Endpoints

-   **GET** `/api/sale-orders`: List sales orders
-   **GET** `/api/sale-orders/<id>`: Get a specific sales order
-   **POST** `/api/sale-orders`: Create a new sales order
-   **PUT** `/api/sale-orders/<id>`: Update a sales order
-   **POST** `/api/sale-orders/<id>/confirm`: Confirm a sales order
-   **POST** `/api/sale-orders/<id>/cancel`: Cancel a sales order
-   **POST** `/api/sale-orders/<id>/draft`: Reset a sales order to draft
